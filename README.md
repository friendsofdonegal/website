This is the code for the friends of donegal website: https://friendsofdonegal.org/

## Build Instructions

1. Make sure you have Node, version 12.18.0, installed. This is the version that Netlify uses to build the site before deployment.  You can download this and install it from the Node [directly](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v12.18.0/) or you could use a tool like [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [Volta](https://volta.sh/).
2. If you are actively developing features, from your favorite terminal, go to the root directory and run `npm run dev`
3. For production builds, run `npm run build` in the root directory
