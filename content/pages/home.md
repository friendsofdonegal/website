## Why?

Friends of Donegal exists because needs exist.  The Donegal Community is comprised of diverse socio- economic groups.  The Donegal area is isolated in many respects due to limited public transportation, access to medical, dental and psychological services.  Unlike more urban settings, our community lacks some of the commodities of a larger town or city, but still has many of the same barriers to self-empowerment and independence. The Donegal area has a rich history in benevolence and resolve to care for its community members.  Friends of Donegal acts as a touchpoint to give the Donegal community an opportunity to continue this tradition of embracing our neighbors and sharing the prosperity and inclusivity our community was founded on.
